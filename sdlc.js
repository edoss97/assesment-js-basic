// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/



// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisofreq = "this is the second step to understand what is required in the code to get the desired outcome"
const design = " the third step and the actual breakdown of the code and structuring the code"
const Implementation = "writing the code out along with the design"
const testingAndIntegration = "checking to ensure the code works and adding it to the desired location for use"
const Maintain = "post code work to ensure the code is staying running and there are no new errors (very long term)"
